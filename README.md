# frogger
unfinished frogger game(collision sucks)

things i learned with this project:
- how to make classes + super classes and how constructor functions work
- how to use drawImage to trace photos so i can draw them onto a canvas
- how to onload a function into the body in html
- how to make point collision to click a start button and start a game up
- how beginPath/rect/fill work
- to make object literals and use this.property to access them globally
- how to integrate a setInterval function
- how to use a switch case to apply movement to an object


to do list:
- figure out how to add collision to my sprites
- add sticky to frog so if it hits a lilypad it sticks to it
- add if player gets to green area +1 on score then reset frog
- add background music
- if timer reaches 0 game over + restart button available
